			<p class="paragraph1"> My name is Cody Duncan, I am an I.T worker for Main Campus Client Services at the University of Toledo,
			and I am also opening my own company, which will be focusing on IT, Computer security, and will also do research and development.
			My degree is in Information Technology. In my free time I like to tinker with different pieces of tech, work on new projects and build whatever comes to mind,
			with a general focus on electronics, robotics, home automation and software.

			Subjects I have experience in: </p>
			<ul class = "skills">
				<li> Java programming </li>
				<li> C++ programming </li>
				<li> Python programming </li>
				<li> 3-D modeling software </li>
				<li> Security testing using Linux distros </li>
				<li> Computer networking (specifically CCNA training and experience with Business Professionals of America) </li>
				<li> Electrical component work (soldering, wiring, etc) </li>
				<li> Eating enough pizza to keep local businesses operating. </li>
			</u1>
			<p class = "paragraph2"> Outside of tinkering in my workshop(room) I occasionally draw, read things other than textbooks and manuals,
			watch science documentaries (especially ones on Space and robotics), and game streaming/recording.
			When I have a free weekend my friends and I usually hang out, whether that means a road trip or
			just gaming and drinking who knows. I consider myself a futurist, which basically means I'm looking forward to the future
			and hoping I can somehow make it better. I can't really think of a quote so I'll just use one I read out of a comic the other
			day.
